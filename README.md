## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Problems and Fixes

### 1. ‚ùå `SSE connection not established` or `500 Internal Server Error`
- Cause: Tool crashed due to large files or invalid UTF-8 content
- Fix: Use `get_file_content` only for small `.txt` files

---

### 2. ‚ùå `MCP error -32001: Request timed out`
- Cause: Tool (e.g. `get_file_content`) taking too long or file is large
- Fix: Use truncated previews or limit to first few KB of content

---

### 3. ‚ùå `Invalid bucket name` or `The specified key does not exist`
- Fix: Ensure no trailing spaces in input fields
- Solution: All tools automatically apply `.strip()` to inputs

---

### 4. üß† JSON formatting issues in `upload_report`
- Fix: Must enter `lines` as valid JSON array:
  ```json
  [
    "Line 1",
    "Line 2"
  ]
